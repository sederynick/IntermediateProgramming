Definition:Recursion is an important programming technique that causes a method to call itself until a condition is met(the base case)
Use: Recursion is commonly used to solve mathematical and graphical problems. For example, recursion can be used to graphically represent 
the Koch Snowflake(a fractal curve) of any order, named after a Swedish Mathematician Niels Fabian Helge von Koch. A fractal is an abstract
object used to describe or simulate naturally occuring phenomenon. 
A Koch Snowflake of a particular order is represented as follows:
1.For order 0, the snowflake is represented as an equilateral triangle.
2.For order 1, each side of the equilateral triangle is divided into 3 equal segments, and the middle segment is used as the base of another
equilateral triangle.
3. This process is repeated for subsequent higher orders to give equilateral triangles of increasingly smaller size and number.
